# tap-beats-per-minute

Single page app to tap out the beats and bars per minute for music. 

Tap the blue button to the beat of some music you're listening to, and the app shows you the beats per minute since first tap (after reset), as well as the bars per minute for 3 beats/bar (eg waltz) and 4 beats per bar (eg foxtrot, rumba)

First tap (after loading or reset) starts timer, subsequent taps increment the counts, and updates the beats/bars per minute on the screen. Tapping for longer will increase the accuracy of the values (by effectively averaging over the longer measurement period)
